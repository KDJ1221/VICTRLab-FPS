1. Create an empty gameObject.

2. Add the BloodSplatter.js or Blood_Splatter.cs script to the gameObject.

3. Assign a blood texture to the "bloodTexture" variable slot.

4. Feel free to tweak the start & end color.

4. Set the duration of the splatter.

5. Drag the gameObject to the Project tab so it becomes a prefab.

6. Simply instantiate the prefab when you want a blood splatter effect.

7. Have fun!
